### The Problem
##### Creativity Drill Assignment.

Provide 3 product/service ideas by combining the characteristics of the followings (any 2 or more at a time).
``` Bird, Vacuum cleaner, Air purifier, Cat ```

Explain major characteristics and functions, types of sensors to be used, how data will be processed and used, user guide.

### Proposed Solutions
1. An mini air purifier incorporated in a bird. 
2. A cleaner device incorporated on a cat(SAVES ELECTRICITY)
3. A vaccum cleaner which does the work of both air cleaning while it takes in the air and also cleaning the floor. (Prototype is such that it will take in the air , the dust particle will get deposited on the cloth and there will be an air cleaner device inside it which will pump out the clean air).

### Characteristics of the given objects

- **Bird**: Flies, has feathers, sings, perches, builds nests, migratory, lays eggs, uses birdhouses, can be pets, maybe carries diseases like avian flu, poops, uses sensors in nature for navigation.

- **Vacuum cleaner**: Cleans floors, suction power, filters, dustbin, automated/Roomba-like, sensors for obstacles, mapping, different modes (carpet, hard floor), HEPA filters, maybe self-emptying.

- **Air purifier**: Filters air, removes allergens, odors, VOCs, uses HEPA, activated carbon, maybe ionizers, sensors for air quality (PM2.5, VOCs), fan speeds adjust automatically, quiet operation, smart features.

- **Cat**: Independent pets, playful, hunt mice, litter box, grooming, scratching posts, sleep a lot, purr, sensors in toys (motion), trackers, health monitors, fur shedding, allergies.

### My Ideas
- A silent Roomba like Vacuum cleaner (**cat + vacuum cleaner**)
- A mobile flying air purifier (**bird+air purifier**)
