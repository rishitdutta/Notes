JTBD Framework is based on the understanding that customers do not purchase products, they rather "**hire**" products to complete certain "**jobs**" for them.

Following this framework allows a product team to discover what the customer is trying to accomplish when they buy a product or a service

By surveying customers on why they'd hire the product and what else they might hire to get the same job done, we uncover insights about the product and it's competitors, which might've been impossible from direct customer feedback.

Key Learnings
- Customer feedback isn't always helpful (it's biased towards their personal goals, their scope is limited by the products they're familiar with.)
- Relying on Customer feedback limits creativity and innovation (in case of Kawasaki Jet Skis, which listened to customer feedback and made the cushion of the foot rest on their standing jet skis more comfy adhering to customer feedback, whilst their competitors launched seated jet skis outperforming Kawasaki.)
- The competitors to a certain product or service may not always be what's expected (Such as in the milkshake case study by Clay Christensen, the competitors turned out to be other quick energy sources that'd keep them engaged in a long drive such as a snickers bar, donut or a bagel, rather than a milkshake by a competitor)
