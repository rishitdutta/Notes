**Low-End Market Framework** follows Low-End Market Disruption, i.e. when a company uses a low cost business model to enter at the **bottom of an existing market** and claim the segment, causing incumbent businesses to retreat upmarket to make higher profit margins. 

In other words, Low End Market Framework aims on capturing the lowest hanging fruit. 

## Toyota and GM
Toyota introduced **Corona** into the US market, which was mainly dominated by General Motors (GM). Corona was a cheap car targeted at the lower end of the market. GM had models that targeted wealthier customers willing to pay for higher quality cars, so they never bothered competing with Toyota. Toyota released more models targeting higher and higher market segments, pushing GM upmarket until they released their luxury series **Lexus**, directly competing with GM in the highest market segment. This is an example of near-successful low-end disruption.
