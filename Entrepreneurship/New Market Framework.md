New Market framework is based on a company creating a product catering to the underserved segment of a market. 

## AirBnB
The founders of AirBnB realised that they were able to provide a very affordable alternative to traditional hotels in the form of a spare room to those who came for a conference in San Francisco. This led them to launch their product which didn't directly compete in the existing segments of the market, rather it created an entirely new unexplored segment.  

Transistor Radios are yet another example of the framework.

The primary feature of New Market disruption is that these companies compete against existing players by going after customers that the original companies weren't interested in, unlike Low End disruption which is based on gaining market share against the existing companies.
